{{ page.title }}
================

When I run rspec in a rails project, rspec printed this line:

    undefined method 'eql' for :page_path:Symbol

I know garb gem do some extentions for Symbol in lib/garb/support.rb file.

    /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems//garb-0.7.6/lib/garb.rb:require 'support'

    /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems//right_http_connection-1.3.0/lib/ \
    right_http_connection.rb:require 'support'

So I guess right_http_connection and garb both requiring 'support' that will cause one of them to be covered! I wrote some test codes to verify my judgment.

First, I unpacked these gems needed to be tested.

    # unpack the installed gem garb to the current directory
    gem unpack garb -v '0.7.6'

    # unpack the installed gem right_http_connection to the current directory
    gem unpack right_http_connection -v '1.3.0'

Then I created two spec files: garb_rhc_spec.rb and rhc_garb_spec.rb.

garb_rhc_spec.rb's contents:

    require 'spec'
    require 'garb-0.7.6/lib/garb'
    require 'right_http_connection-1.3.0/lib/right_http_connection'

    describe 'first require garb, then require right_http_connection' do
      it 'Symbol instance should response to eql' do
        :a.eql.should be_instance_of SymbolOperator
      end
    end

rhc_garb_spec.rb's contents:

    require 'spec'
    require 'right_http_connection-1.3.0/lib/right_http_connection'
    require 'garb-0.7.6/lib/garb'

    describe 'first require right_http_connection then require garb' do
      it 'Symbol instance should response to eql' do
        lambda{ :a.eql}.should raise_exception(NoMethodError)
      end
    end

These two specs have passed, so my guess was right.
If you sank into the same problem, you ought to check if there are files also require 'support' like garb.

I install a lower version right_http_connection and the problem vanlished.

    sudo gem uninstall right_http_connection -v '1.3.0'
    sudo gem install right_http_connection -v '1.2.4'

The gem right_http_connection-1.2.4 dose not require 'support':)
