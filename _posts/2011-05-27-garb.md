title: The conflict about both requiring garb and right_http_connection

---

{{ page.title }}
----------------

When I ran spec in a rails project, rspec printed following line:

    undefined method 'eql' for :page_path:Symbol

I know the garb gem has some extention codes for Symbol in lib/garb/support.rb file.
I used command {% highlight bash %} find /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/ -name "*.rb" -print | xargs grep '\<support\>' | grep  'require' {% endhighlight %} to find files that contain codes require 'support'.
In your computer, you should change the path "/Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/" to your gem installed dir.

    /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/garb-0.7.6/lib/garb.rb:require 'support'
    /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/right_http_connection-1.3.0/lib/right_http_connection.rb:require 'support'

So I guess right_http_connection and garb both require 'support' will cause one of them not to be required. I wrote some test codes to verify my judgment.
First, unpack these gems needed to be tested.

    gem unpack garb -v '0.7.6'
    gem unpack right_http_connection -v '1.3.0'

Then I changed garb-0.7.6/lib/garb.rb:line 23 from
    {% highlight ruby %}
    require 'support'
    {% endhighlight %%}
to
    {% highlight ruby %}
    if require 'support'
      puts 'garb support has loaded'
    else
      puts 'garb support has not loaded'
    end
    {% endhighlight %}
Then I created two spec files: garb_rhc_spec.rb and rhc_garb_spec.rb.

garb_rhc_spec.rb's contents:

    {% highlight ruby %}
    require 'spec'
    require 'garb-0.7.6/lib/garb'
    require 'right_http_connection-1.3.0/lib/right_http_connection'

    describe 'first require garb, then require right_http_connection' do
      it 'Symbol instance should response to eql' do
        :a.eql.should be_instance_of SymbolOperator
      end
    end
    {% endhighlight %}

rhc_garb_spec.rb's contents:

    {% highlight ruby %}
    require 'spec'
    require 'right_http_connection-1.3.0/lib/right_http_connection'
    require 'garb-0.7.6/lib/garb'

    describe 'first require right_http_connection then require garb' do
      it 'Symbol instance should response to eql' do
        lambda{ :a.eql}.should raise_exception(NoMethodError)
      end
    end
    {% endhighlight %}

garb_rhc_spec passed and printed "garb support has loaded", rhc_garb_spec passed and printed "garb support has not loaded"

If you sank into the same problem, you ought to check if there are files also require 'support' like garb.

I install a lower version right_http_connection and the problem vanlished.

    {% highlight bash %}
    sudo gem uninstall right_http_connection -v '1.3.0'
    sudo gem install right_http_connection -v '1.2.4'
    {% endhighlight %}

The gem right_http_connection-1.2.4 dose not require 'support':)
